4. chatbot.js (Production)
--------------------------
Production chatbot file deployed to Netlify:

Purpose: Client-side chatbot that calls Netlify serverless function

Key Components:
- portfolioContext: Complete resume data for AI context
- sendToHuggingFace(): Calls /.netlify/functions/chat endpoint
- generateSmartResponse(): Comprehensive fallback responses
- addMessage(): Displays messages in chat interface
- sendMessage(): Handles user input
- toggleChatbot(): Opens/closes chat widget
- quickQuestion(): Pre-filled question buttons

Fallback Response Categories:
- Greetings (Hi, Hello, Hey)
- Skills (AI, Python, ML, Data, Cloud)
- Experience (Infosys work details)
- Education (IIT Patna, MCA, BCA)
- Projects (RAG Chatbot, DeepEval, LangGraph)
- Certifications (Google, Microsoft, Infosys)
- Achievements (Awards and recognition)
- Languages (English, Hindi)
- Machine Learning specifics
- SQL/Data Engineering specifics
- Azure/Cloud specifics
- Contact information

API Integration:
- Calls Netlify Function at /.netlify/functions/chat
- Sends user message as POST request
- Receives AI-generated response
- Falls back to keyword responses if API fails


5. chatbot-hf.js (Development)
------------------------------
Development version with direct Hugging Face API access:

Purpose: Local testing with API key (NOT deployed)

Differences from chatbot.js:
- Contains actual Hugging Face API key
- Calls HF API directly (not through Netlify Function)
- Same fallback responses as chatbot.js
- Used for local development only

Security:
- File is in .gitignore
- API key never pushed to GitHub
- Only used for local testing


6. netlify/functions/chat.js
----------------------------
Serverless function for chatbot backend:

Purpose: Secure API proxy for Hugging Face

How it works:
1. Receives POST request from chatbot.js
2. Extracts user message from request body
3. Calls Hugging Face API with full resume context
4. Returns AI-generated response to client
5. Falls back to keyword responses if API fails

Environment Variables:
- HF_API_KEY: Hugging Face API key (set in Netlify dashboard)
  Note: Free tier doesn't support env vars, so key is hardcoded

API Configuration:
- Model: HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
- Max tokens: 150
- Temperature: 0.7
- Top P: 0.95

Security Benefits:
- API key hidden from client-side code
- Server-side execution prevents key exposure
- Rate limiting handled by Netlify


7. netlify.toml
---------------
Netlify deployment configuration:

Content:
[build]
  functions = "netlify/functions"

Purpose:
- Tells Netlify where serverless functions are located
- Enables automatic function deployment


8. .gitignore
-------------
Files excluded from Git:

Ignored Files:
- node_modules/
- build/
- .DS_Store
- *.log
- .env
- .env.local
- chatbot-hf.js (contains API key)
- .netlify/ (local Netlify build artifacts)

Purpose:
- Protects sensitive information (API keys)
- Excludes build artifacts
- Keeps repository clean


CHATBOT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

Architecture:
Client (chatbot.js) → Netlify Function (chat.js) → Hugging Face API

Data Flow:
1. User types question in chatbot
2. chatbot.js sends POST to /.netlify/functions/chat
3. Netlify Function receives request
4. Function calls Hugging Face API with full context
5. HF API generates response using Zephyr-7B model
6. Function returns response to client
7. chatbot.js displays response to user
8. If any step fails, fallback responses are used

Resume Context:
The chatbot has complete resume information embedded:
- Professional Summary
- Contact Information
- Work Experience (detailed responsibilities)
- Education (3 degrees with focus areas)
- Technical Expertise (6 categories)
- Projects (3 AI projects with full details)
- Achievements (Infosys award)
- Certifications (5 certifications)
- Languages (English, Hindi)

Fallback System:
Comprehensive keyword-based responses covering:
- 15+ different question categories
- Detailed multi-paragraph responses
- Emoji-enhanced formatting
- Specific technical details
- Contact information
- Project descriptions

User Experience:
- Floating chat button (bottom-right)
- Slide-up chat window
- Quick question buttons
- Typing indicator animation
- Smooth message animations
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Enter key to send


DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
================================================================================

Initial Setup:
1. Created portfolio files locally
2. Initialized Git repository
3. Created GitHub repository
4. Pushed code to GitHub

Netlify Deployment:
1. Connected GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Configured build settings (none needed for static site)
3. Set functions directory to netlify/functions
4. Deployed automatically on push

Continuous Deployment:
- Every git push to main branch triggers auto-deploy
- Netlify builds and deploys within 1-2 minutes
- Functions are automatically deployed
- Live site updates immediately

Domain:
- Netlify subdomain: shivamsavarn.netlify.app
- Can add custom domain in Netlify settings


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

API Key Protection:
- chatbot-hf.js in .gitignore (never committed)
- API key in serverless function (server-side only)
- GitHub push protection detected and blocked exposed key
- Netlify Functions hide implementation from client

Best Practices:
- Sensitive files excluded from Git
- Server-side API calls only
- No credentials in client-side code
- Environment variables for production (if available)

GitHub Security:
- GitHub Secret Scanning detected API key
- Push was blocked until key removed
- Forced to use environment variable approach
